# PRD: Add compound learnings to RULE.md from daily context

**Priority #1 from backlog.** Implemented by agents-running-on-cursor (Cursor test).

## Goal

Ensure the project has a living knowledge base (RULE.md) and that daily context (`logs/daily-context.md`) is the source for compound review.

## Done

- [x] Create **RULE.md** at repo root with project context, compound review instructions, and conventions.
- [x] Document that **logs/daily-context.md** is where to paste daily work summary; compound review merges it into RULE.md / .cursor/rules.

## Next (from backlog)

- Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or AGENT_CMD for nightly compound review (optional).
- Discord bot improvements.
- Grading / market automation.
